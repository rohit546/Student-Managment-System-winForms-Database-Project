# Student-Managment-System-winForms-Database-Project
This is my 3rd Semester Project 


The Student Management System (SMS) is a centralized system used by teachers,
students, and administrators to collect information needed to manage all core features of a school's
operations. The system provides various functionalities to manage teacher data records, student
data records, class records, and administrative tasks. This manual will guide you through the
development process of a Student Management System that contains functionalities of three major
entities i.e., teachers, students, and classes.



Features:
The SMS system should contain the following features:

Administrator Module:

Add new Teacher: The system should ask for the following credentials to register a new teacher:
• First Name
• Last Name
• T-id (should be auto-generated by the system in increasing order) [format should be
Teacher e.g., 1 for the first teacher and 1001 for one thousand and one teacher number]
• Username
• Email
• Registration Date
• Gender
• Blood Group
• Contact No
• Address



Add new Student: The system should ask for the following credentials to register a new student:
• First Name
• Last Name
• S-id (should be auto-generated by the system in increasing order) [format should be Student
e.g., 1 for the first student and 1001 for one thousand and one student number]
• Registration Date
• Gender
• Contact No
• Blood Group
• Address
• Fees paid status (true/false)


Edit Teacher details: The system should allow the administrator to edit the following details of a
teacher:



• First Name
• Last Name
• Address
• Contact No
• Username
• Email




Edit Student details: The system should allow the administrator to edit the following details of a
student:
• First Name
• Last Name
• Address
• Contact No
• Username
• Email





Teacher Module:
View Student List: The system should allow the teacher to view the list of all students along with
their details.

Add Attendance: The system should allow the teacher to mark attendance for each student.
View Class List: The system should allow the teacher to view a list of all classes that they teach,
along with the details of each student enrolled in each class.

View Attendance Report: The system should allow the teacher to view the attendance report of
each student.

The attendance records should include the following information for each student:

• Name
• Roll Number
• Total Number of Classes
• Number of Classes Attended
• Percentage of Attendance




Student Module:

View Attendance Report: The system should allow the student to view his/her attendance report.

View Class Schedule: The system should allow the students to view their class Schedule.



Class Module:

Create New Class: The system should allow the administrator to create a new class.


Add Students to Class: The system should allow the administrator to add students to a class.
View Class List: The system should allow the administrator to view the list of all classes along
with their details.


View Student List in Class: The system should allow the administrator to view the list of students
in a class.


Schedule Class: The system should allow the administrator to schedule a class by setting the class
start time, end time, and the day(s) of the week it occurs. The system should also allow the
administrator to assign a teacher to the class and a classroom location. Once scheduled, the class
information should be stored in a database table named "class_schedule".


User Authentication:
• The system should have a login system for the administrator, teacher, and student. • The
system should have password hashing and salting to ensure the security of user data.

Database Integration:
The system should use a database to store all the data.
Technology Stack:


The following technologies are recommended for developing the SMS system:

• Domain: Web application OR Desktop application

• Database: Oracle (Mandatory)
Concept Rubrics:

All the major concepts (SQL & PL/SQL) should be used to implement project features. Your
project will be evaluated accordingly.
Note:
• SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, Grouping, Nested queries, joins, Views, Indexing, Built-in
functions)
• PL/SQL (Conditional statements, Loops, Procedures/Functions/Packages, Triggers,
Cursors)
